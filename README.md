# confirm-pam

A CLI tool for biometric authentication confirmation.

## Overview

`confirm-pam` is a command-line tool that provides biometric authentication (fingerprint/Touch ID) confirmation prompts. It's designed to prevent automated tools (including AI agents) from bypassing security checks like `git commit --no-verify`.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Touch ID authentication on macOS
- üîê Custom message display during authentication prompt
- üö¶ Simple exit codes: 0 for success, 1 for failure/cancel, 2 for errors
- ü™∂ Lightweight binary with minimal dependencies
- üöÄ Fast native performance

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/azu/confirm-pam
cd confirm-pam
cargo build --release

# Copy to PATH
sudo cp target/release/confirm-pam /usr/local/bin/
```

### Homebrew

```bash
# One-liner install
brew tap azu/confirm-pam https://github.com/azu/confirm-pam && brew install azu/confirm-pam/confirm-pam
```

Or step by step:
```bash
# Add the tap
brew tap azu/confirm-pam https://github.com/azu/confirm-pam
# Install
brew install azu/confirm-pam/confirm-pam
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
confirm-pam "Your authentication message here"
```

### Exit Codes

- `0` - Authentication successful
- `1` - User cancelled authentication
- `2` - Error occurred (biometrics unavailable, etc.)

### Shell Script Integration

```bash
if confirm-pam "Allow sensitive operation?"; then
    echo "Authenticated - proceeding"
else
    echo "Authentication failed or cancelled"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Git Hook Example

Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Prevent --no-verify without biometric confirmation
if [[ "$GIT_PARAMS" == *"--no-verify"* ]]; then
    if ! confirm-pam "Allow bypassing git hooks with --no-verify?"; then
        echo "‚ùå Touch ID authentication required to use --no-verify"
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```
