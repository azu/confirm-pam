# confirm-pam

A CLI tool for biometric authentication confirmation.

## Overview

`confirm-pam` is a command-line tool that provides biometric authentication (fingerprint/Touch ID) confirmation prompts. It's designed to prevent automated tools (including AI agents) from bypassing security checks like `git commit --no-verify`.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Touch ID authentication on macOS
- üîê Custom message display during authentication prompt
- üö¶ Simple exit codes: 0 for success, 1 for failure/cancel, 2 for errors
- ü™∂ Lightweight binary with minimal dependencies
- üöÄ Fast native performance

## Installation

### From crates.io (Recommended)

```bash
cargo install confirm-pam
```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/azu/confirm-pam
cd confirm-pam
cargo build --release

# Copy to PATH
sudo cp target/release/confirm-pam /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
confirm-pam "Your authentication message here"
```

### Exit Codes

- `0` - Authentication successful
- `1` - User cancelled authentication
- `2` - Error occurred (biometrics unavailable, etc.)

### Shell Script Integration

```bash
if confirm-pam "Allow sensitive operation?"; then
    echo "Authenticated - proceeding"
else
    echo "Authentication failed or cancelled"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Git Hook Example

Override `git` command to include confirmation prompts.

zsh example:

```zsh
# Override git push -f and commit --no-verify
 git() {
   if [[ $@ == *'push'* && $@ == *'-f'* ]]; then
     echo "Use git push --force-with-lease --force-if-includes instead"
   elif [[ $@ == *'commit'* && $@ == *'--no-verify'* ]]; then
     if confirm-pam "Allow commit with --no-verify?"; then
       echo "Authenticated Failed - Disallow commit by human. Please wait..."
       preexec_git_global_hooks # add commit hook
       command git "$@"
     else
       echo "Authentication failed or cancelled"
       return 1
     fi
   else
     preexec_git_global_hooks # add commit hook
     command git "$@"
```

## Requirements

### macOS

- macOS 10.12.2 or later
- Touch ID capable device
- Touch ID must be configured in System Preferences

## Development

### Using Make Commands

```bash
# Show available commands
make help

# Build the project
make build

# Run all tests (unit + lint + format check)
make test

# Run Touch ID integration tests (requires user interaction)
make dev-test

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Install to system PATH
make install

# Create a release (tag + build)
make release
```

### Using Cargo Directly

```bash
# Run tests
cargo test

# Run integration tests (requires user interaction)
./test_touchid.sh

# Build for release
cargo build --release

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy
```

## Release Process

This project uses **local manual releases** with make commands:

### Release Commands

```bash
# Patch release (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.1.1): Bug fixes, small improvements

```

### What happens automatically

1. ‚úÖ Version bumped in `Cargo.toml` using semver
2. ‚úÖ Git tag created and pushed
3. ‚úÖ Published to crates.io
4. ‚úÖ GitHub release created with binaries

### Manual Release Steps

<details>
